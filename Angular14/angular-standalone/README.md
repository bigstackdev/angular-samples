# AngularStandalone

In Angular v14 and higher, standalone components provide a simplified way to build Angular applications. Standalone components, directives, and pipes aim to streamline the authoring experience by reducing the need for NgModules. Existing applications can optionally and incrementally adopt the new standalone style without any breaking changes.

Note : The standalone component feature is available for developer preview. It's ready for you to try, but it might change before it is stable.

## Standalone option

Run `ng g c  HomePage -â€”standalone=true` to generate a standalone component through ng cli tool
